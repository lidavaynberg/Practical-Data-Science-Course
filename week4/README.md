# Week 4: Organizing Projects with GitHub + First Encounter with AI Helpers

## 📚 Overview

This week you'll learn how to organize your data science projects using GitHub and discover how AI coding assistants (like Copilot and ChatGPT) can help you debug, explain, and improve your code. You'll set up your first project repository and practice using AI tools for code understanding.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Create and organize a GitHub repository for your project
- Commit and track changes to notebooks and datasets
- Write and update README files to document your work
- Use AI coding assistants to explain code and suggest improvements
- Collaborate and share your work with others

## 🎓 Session Structure (80 minutes)

### Lecture (40 minutes): GitHub for Data Science & AI Helpers
- Why version control matters for reproducible science and social impact
- GitHub basics: repositories, commits, branches, README files
- How to upload notebooks and datasets
- Introduction to AI coding assistants: Copilot, ChatGPT, Bard
- How AI can help with debugging, code explanation, and refactoring

### Tutorial (40 minutes): Setting Up Your Project & Using AI
- Create a new GitHub repository for your project
- Upload a cleaned dataset and your notebook
- Write a README file describing your project and its social impact goal
- Use an AI assistant to explain a code snippet in plain English
- Practice making commits and tracking changes

## 🏗️ Mini-Deliverable

**Assignment:** A GitHub repo with your first project files and a README draft.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload your cleaned dataset and Week 1/2 notebook
3. Write a README file describing your project and its social impact focus
4. Use an AI assistant to explain a code snippet and include the explanation in your repo
