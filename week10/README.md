## 📋 Presentation Guidelines

### ⏰ Time Management (3 minutes total)
- **Introduction** (30 seconds) - Your name, project title, social issue
- **Problem and Data** (1 minute) - Why this matters, what data you used
- **Key Findings** (1 minute) - What you discovered, insights, model results
- **App Demo** (30 seconds) - Quick demonstration of your Streamlit app

### 🎯 Content Focus
- **Start with impact** - Why does your social issue matter?
- **Show, don't just tell** - Use visuals and your app demo
- **Highlight insights** - What did you learn from the data?
- **Connect to change** - How could your work inform action?

### 💡 Presentation Tips
- **Practice timing** - Rehearse multiple times to stay within 3 minutes
- **Prepare for technical issues** - Have screenshots as backup
- **Speak clearly** - Project your voice and make eye contact
- **Show enthusiasm** - Your passion for the issue should be evident
- **End strong** - Conclude with your key message or call to action

### Example Presentation Outline:
```
"Climate Change Impact on Global Food Security" 

[30 sec] "Hi, I'm Sarah, and I built a tool to explore how rising temperatures 
affect crop yields worldwide - a critical issue as we face climate change 
and need to feed a growing population."

[1 min] "I combined temperature data from NASA with crop yield data from 
the World Bank covering 50 countries over 20 years. I found that wheat 
yields decline by an average of 3% for every 1°C increase in temperature, 
but the impact varies dramatically by region."

[1 min] "My predictive model shows that without adaptation, we could see 
20% lower wheat yields by 2050 in key agricultural regions. However, the 
data also reveals that countries investing in climate-resilient agriculture 
are maintaining stable yields despite temperature increases."

[30 sec] [Demo app] "My Streamlit app lets policymakers explore these 
relationships for different crops and regions, helping them prioritize 
climate adaptation investments. You can upload your own agricultural 
data and see these patterns in your area."
```
