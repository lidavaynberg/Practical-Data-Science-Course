## 📁 Common Project Challenges and Solutions

### 🔧 Technical Issues

**"My code has errors"**
- Bring the error message and code to office hours
- Use AI assistants to help debug (ChatGPT, Copilot)
- Check that all required libraries are installed
- Test your code step by step in small pieces

**"My Streamlit app won't run"**
- Verify all imports work correctly
- Check file paths and data loading
- Test locally before deployment
- Bring your app file to office hours for debugging

**"My data is messy"**
- Don't aim for perfect data - focus on what's possible
- Document your cleaning decisions
- Show before/after examples
- Ask for help prioritizing which issues to fix

### 📊 Project Scope Issues

**"My project is too complicated"**
- Focus on one specific question or use case
- Choose a subset of your data to work with
- Aim for a simple, working solution over complex features
- Remember: better to do less well than more poorly

**"I can't find the right data"**
- Use the APIs and datasets from previous weeks
- Combine multiple smaller datasets
- Focus on publicly available data sources
- Consider using sample data to demonstrate your approach

**"My model isn't working well"**
- Simple models are fine for this course
- Focus on interpretation over performance
- Use the model to gain insights, not make perfect predictions
- Document what you learned from the modeling process

### 🎨 Design and Communication

**"My app looks basic"**
- Clean and simple is better than complex and confusing
- Focus on functionality and user experience
- Get feedback from classmates who aren't familiar with your project
- Use Streamlit's built-in styling rather than custom CSS

**"I don't know what story to tell"**
- Start with your social issue and why it matters
- Show what you discovered in your data
- Explain how your tools could help address the problem
- Focus on insights and implications, not just technical details
